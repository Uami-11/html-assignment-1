    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>As seen in my hobbies, I really like <strong>games programming</strong>. I have made games through a lot of ways,
        including <em>Python</em> using the <em>Python</em> library, <em>Scratch</em>, and the game engines <em>GameMaker</em> and <em>Godot</em>.
    </p>

        I also like reading, my favorite authors are <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong>, <strong>Joe Abercrombe</strong>, and <strong>Matt Dinniman</strong>. 
        My favorite book is <em>The Way of Kings</em>.

        I go cycling everyday through my commute to college. And later in the day I exercise at the gym.
