        <h2>CSS Facts</h2>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to control the appearance of web pages. While HTML structures
            the content of a page, CSS defines how that content looks to users. It handles visual aspects such as colors,
            fonts, spacing, borders, and positioning. By separating design from content, CSS makes websites easier to
            manage and update.</p>

        <p>One of the core ideas in CSS is the use of selectors and rules. Selectors determine which HTML elements are
            affected, while rules define the styles applied to them. This system allows developers to apply consistent
            design choices across many elements at once. The “cascading” nature of CSS means that when multiple rules
            apply, priority is determined by specificity, order, and inheritance.</p>

        <p>
            CSS also plays a major role in page layout. Modern CSS features make it possible to arrange content in flexible
            and responsive ways, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This is essential in today's web
            environment, where users access websites on phones, tablets, and desktops. Good layout design improves 
            readability and user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another important strength of CSS is responsiveness and adaptability. CSS enables websites to adjust their
            design based on screen size, orientation, or device capabilities. This helps ensure that a single website
            works well across many platforms without needing separate versions. Responsive design has become a standard
            expectation for modern websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, CSS improves maintainability and efficiency in web development. A single CSS file can control the styling of
            an entire website, making global changes fast and consistent. This reduces duplication, improves performance, and makes
            collaboration easier in team environments. Overall, CSS is a foundational technology that makes the web visually engaging
            and user-friendly.
